# ONT Straglr

This image contains the Straglr version used by ONT in their `wf-human-variation`. It is a slightly [modified fork](https://github.com/philres/straglr) of the original Straglr from 2023.

This versions output is more compatible with the Geneyx tool as the original Straglr has been significantly updated and now outputs quite a different format.
