# docker-images


This repo contains Dockerfiles to generate images that are needed for SACGF pipelines but for which no current public image exists.

Tools available via public package repositories such as PyPI or BioConda should have containers sourced elsewhere e.g. [Seqera Containers](https://seqera.io/containers), [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro).

The images here are built and published automatically by CI/CD under the SACGF organisation.
